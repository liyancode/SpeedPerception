  <h2> What is SpeedPerception? </h2>
  
  <p>
   Clearly, no one likes slow loading webpages. SpeedPerception is a study trying to understand what “slow” and “fast” mean to the human end-user. You can help improve webpage speed by taking part in the SpeedPerception Challenge. <b>Click on the <a href="/challenge" target="#">Challenge</a> in the menu to play!</b>

  SpeedPerception is a large-scale web performance crowdsourcing study focused on the perceived loading performance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_the_fold" target="#">above-the-fold</a> content. Traditional web performance metrics defined in  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/" target="#">W3C</a> standards focus on timing each process along the content delivery pipeline, such as Time to First Byte (TTFB) and Page Load Time. We want to tackle the web performance measurement challenge by looking at it from a different angle, one which puts user experience into focus. Since people primarily consume the web visually, we are focusing on the visual perception of the webpage loading process.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the current version, SpeedPerception provides sample video pairs generated from <a herf="http://www.webpagetest.org/">http://www.webpagetest.org/</a> (WPT) using Internet Retailer top-500 (IR500) website home pages. A total of 21 pairs are displayed during each session, and participants are requested to complete at least one session (21 pairs) of survey. Some of these pairs are randomly drawn from pairs where the correct choice is known a-priori. The challenge is to get 100% score on the known pairs by the end of each session.
  </p>

  <h2>What is the goal of SpeedPerception?</h2>
  <p>
  Our goal is to create a free, open-source, benchmark dataset to advance the systematic study of how human end-users perceive the webpage loading process: the above-the-fold rendering in particular. Our belief (and hope) is that such a benchmark can provide a quantitative basis to compare different algorithms and spur computer scientists to make progress on helping quantify perceived webpage performance.

  <h2>How was SpeedPerception created?</h2>
  <p>We use Patrick Meenan’s open-source WebPagetest (a.k.a WPT) to test 300+ home pages from the IR500 list on June 2016. Videos were generated and downloaded from WPT, processed into gif format, then incorporated into SpeedPerception . The video pairs presented were selected under a set of rules to better help us limit bias and randomness (the <a herf="https://github.com/pdey/SpeedPerception">rules are available on GitHub</a>).</p>

  <p>Based on the mathematical formulation of <a herf="https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index">SpeedIndex</a> (SI) and <a herf="https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/visualmetrics">PerceptualSpeedIndex</a> (PSI), comparison between videos mainly make sense when they have similar “Visual Complete” timings: the page rendering processes finish in comparable time-frames.

  <p>All the pre-processing steps and video curation code can be found on GitHub at: <a href="https://github.com/pdey/SpeedPerception" target="#">https://github.com/pdey/SpeedPerception</a></p>
  
  <p> Once the crowd-sourcing component generates a sufficient amount of user data, we will open source the dataset, making it available to the web performance community, along with the analysis of what we discover.
